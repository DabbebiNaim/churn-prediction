# Data Analyst Internship: Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and associated files for my Data Analyst internship project focused on predicting customer churn.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze customer data to identify the key drivers of churn and build a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to leave. This work was completed as part of my Data Analyst internship.

### Key Responsibilities:
*   Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
*   Developed and compared four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
*   Identified key churn drivers and at-risk customer segments using model interpretation techniques.
*   Prepared and presented actionable insights derived from the analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the **"Bank Customer Churn Prediction"** dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Technologies Used
*   **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
*   **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Download the dataset from the link above and place the `Churn_Modelling.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.
3.  Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost`
4.  Open and run the `your_notebook_name.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
