Data Analyst Internship: Customer Churn Prediction
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and associated files for my Data Analyst internship project focused on predicting customer churn.
Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze customer data to identify the key drivers of churn and build a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to leave. This work was completed as part of my Data Analyst internship.
Key Responsibilities:
Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Developed and compared four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Identified key churn drivers and at-risk customer segments using model interpretation techniques.
Prepared and presented actionable insights derived from the analysis.
Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.
